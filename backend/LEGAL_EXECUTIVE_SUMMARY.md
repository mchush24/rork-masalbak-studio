## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T
1. Vague language: "We may share data with partners" → ✅ Name specific partners (OpenAI, Supabase)
2. Single disclaimer buried in fine print → ✅ Multiple prominent disclaimers + UI display
3. Generic "not medical advice" → ✅ Specific: NOT diagnostic, when to seek help, emergencies
4. No timeframes for data retention → ✅ Specific: 90 days account, 30 days drawings
5. Claim HIPAA compliance → ✅ We're NOT HIPAA-covered (not a healthcare provider)
6. Ignore jurisdiction-specific laws → ✅ Turkish (KVKK), EU (GDPR), US (COPPA)

### ✅ DO
1. Be transparent and specific (name third parties, timeframes, data types)
2. Use visual formatting for critical info (❌, ⚠️, bold, ALL CAPS for disclaimers)
3. Provide actionable guidance (when to seek help, how to delete data)
4. Implement in UI (not just legal documents - show in app)
5. Keep updated (review quarterly, update when service changes)
6. Log user consents (timestamp, IP, what they consented to)
